# EasyShop Solution Overview

## Project Summary
EasyShop is a modern, cloud-native e-commerce platform built with Next.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB. The project demonstrates advanced DevOps practices, including infrastructure automation with Crossplane, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and scalable deployment to AWS EKS using Helm charts.

---

## Infrastructure Provisioning with Crossplane
- **Crossplane** is used to provision and manage AWS infrastructure using Kubernetes-style YAML manifests.
- Key resources provisioned:
  - **VPC** with public/private subnets, NAT and Internet Gateways
  - **Security Groups** for network access control
  - **IAM Roles and Policies** for EKS and node groups
  - **EKS Cluster** with managed node groups for scalable compute
- All infrastructure is defined as code, versioned, and applied declaratively, enabling reproducible and auditable environments.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
- **GitHub Actions** automates the build, test, security scan, and deployment process:
  1. **Build & Test:**
     - Builds Docker images for the app and migration jobs
     - Runs unit tests and static analysis
  2. **Security:**
     - Scans code and images for vulnerabilities (Trivy, SonarQube)
  3. **Push:**
     - Pushes versioned images to Docker Hub
  4. **Manifest Update:**
     - Updates deployment manifests with new image tags
  5. **Deploy:**
     - Applies changes to the EKS cluster
- The pipeline ensures every code change is validated, secure, and automatically delivered to production.

---

## Deployment on EKS with Helm Charts
- **Helm** is used to package and deploy the application to the EKS cluster.
- Helm charts manage all Kubernetes resources for the app, including deployments, services, ingress, configmaps, and secrets.
- Benefits of using Helm:
  - Simplifies deployment and upgrades
  - Supports parameterization for different environments
  - Enables easy rollback and version control of releases
- The deployment process:
  1. Helm charts are templated with environment-specific values
  2. GitHub Actions (or ArgoCD/Jenkins) triggers `helm upgrade --install` to deploy or update the app on EKS
  3. Application is exposed via NGINX Ingress and secured with cert-manager for HTTPS

---

## Key Advantages
- **Cloud Native:** All infrastructure and deployment is managed as code
- **Automated:** End-to-end automation from code commit to production
- **Scalable & Secure:** EKS provides managed Kubernetes, Crossplane ensures secure AWS resource provisioning, and Helm enables reliable application delivery

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a robust, production-grade DevOps workflow using Crossplane for AWS infrastructure, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and Helm for application deployment on EKS. The result is a scalable, secure, and maintainable e-commerce platform ready for real-world use.
