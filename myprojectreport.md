📄 Project Report: End-to-End DevOps-Based E-Commerce Application
🧠 Objective of the Project:
The goal was to design, develop, and deploy a complete E-Commerce application using DevOps practices, focusing on automation, scalability, continuous delivery, security, and cloud-native deployment.
The entire lifecycle — from code to production — was automated using industry-standard tools.

🏗️ Architecture Overview:
The project is built using a microservice-style architecture (frontend + backend) and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS EKS, following GitOps principles using ArgoCD.

🔧 Tech Stack & Tools:
💻 Frontend:
Technology: ReactJS

Deployment: Served through Nginx Docker container

Features: Dynamic UI for shopping, cart, login, and product browsing

⚙️ Backend:
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)

API Layer: Node.js with RESTful APIs

Containerization: Backend and DB containerized using Docker

🔁 CI/CD Workflow:
1️⃣ Version Control:
Code stored and managed using GitHub

2️⃣ CI - Continuous Integration (Jenkins):
Configured Jenkins Pipeline to:

Pull code from GitHub

Build Docker images for frontend & backend

Run basic tests and code quality scans

Push Docker images to DockerHub

3️⃣ Security & Quality:
SonarQube:

Integrated with Jenkins to scan code for vulnerabilities and bugs

Send email alerts for quality gate failures

Docker Image Hardening (Best practices followed)

4️⃣ CD - Continuous Delivery (GitOps using ArgoCD):
ArgoCD pulls Kubernetes manifests from GitHub repo

Automatically syncs and deploys applications on the AWS EKS cluster

☁️ Infrastructure Setup:
🌍 Cloud Provider:
Amazon Web Services (AWS)

🔨 Tools Used:
Terraform:

Provisioned AWS infrastructure — VPC, Subnets, EKS Cluster, IAM roles, etc.

Ansible:

Installed and configured software packages on EC2

Set up Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, and ArgoCD

📦 Kubernetes Deployment:
Used YAML files to deploy frontend, backend, and MongoDB as separate pods

Implemented Services, Deployments, PersistentVolumes, and Secrets

Used kubectl and ArgoCD to monitor and manage deployments

⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions:

Challenge	Solution
kubectl not connecting to EKS	Verified kubeconfig and IAM roles; reconfigured access
ArgoCD sync errors	Debugged YAML, fixed imagePullPolicy, corrected deployment metadata
Terraform permission denied	Attached correct IAM policy to the user & used AWS CLI for debugging
Pod log visibility issue	Used kubectl logs and installed lens IDE for Kubernetes
💡 Key Learnings:
How to create scalable and portable applications using Docker & Kubernetes

Automating DevOps pipeline from scratch

Setting up a production-grade CI/CD flow using Jenkins and ArgoCD

GitOps for declarative deployment management

Cloud provisioning using Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

Secure and efficient deployment practices

📈 Future Integrations (Planned):
Prometheus:

To collect performance metrics from Kubernetes pods, nodes, and services

Integration with Node Exporter and Kube-State-Metrics

Grafana:

For creating real-time dashboards from Prometheus metrics

Visualize CPU, memory, HTTP request rates, etc.

Slack/PagerDuty Integration:

For production-level alerting and incident response

✅ Conclusion:
This project simulates a real-world, enterprise-grade CI/CD and deployment pipeline for a modern web application. It reflects my hands-on understanding of the DevOps lifecycle, showcases my ability to manage cloud resources, and demonstrates how I can build, test, secure, and deploy applications in a completely automated environment.
